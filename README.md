GOBLINS!

======== 

A console, text game where you fight goblins in a dungeon, a la "The Typing of the Dead"
I built this to experiment with making an event-driven program from scratch. 

Features:
	-Adaptive difficulty system that adjusts enemy spawns, word length based on player performance
	-Spell checking and timing systems for player-entered words
	-Stat-tracking system utilizing callback functions

To install:
	- Download Goblins.exe and "words.txt"
	
Note that in order for Goblins.exe to run, the "words.txt" file must be in the same folder as it.

I got word bank the game using from here:
https://github.com/dwyl/english-words

So my thanks to them for making my life a lot easier. Copyright of all the words still belongs to them.

That said, be warned that the word bank may include some inappropriate words, since there's a bevy of them in the
original word bank. I deleted a lot of them, but it's completely possible that I missed some, especially if 
they're in a different language. Sorry in advance.
